# Island-Menu

Modifies the main menu to be themed around [MCC Island](https://mccisland.net/). Requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)

## Features:

### Themed Splash Text

Randomly picks a fun themed splash text for the main menu, and can even use the MCC API to get real-time information about the latest MCC event. (For example you could see a splash text telling you when the next MCC event is or a random creator in the event)

### Panorama from the Island

The normal main menu panorama is replaced by a panorama from the MCC Island spawn, and in addition as various holidays arrive the panorama has an increasing chance of being replaced by a themed panorama.

### Quick-join button

One-click button to automatically connect to MCC Island.

### Configuration

All of the previous features mentioned above can be configured. You can overwrite the splash text, manually set the theme, and even configure what the join button says.


## Known Mod Compatibility:
- [Replay Mod](https://replaymod.com/)'s button appears correctly.
- If you encounter an issue or have any suggestions, [please let me know](https://github.com/MoSadie/Island-Menu/issues)!
